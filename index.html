                        Hi, I'm Pranay Ranjan. I'm an event organiser and a community builder by passion and a Biotech
                        Engineer by profession.
                        I've completed my graduation from SRM, KTR Campus, Chennai. Like all other freshmen, I was
                        perplexed and ended up
                        joining various technical and non technical clubs to find out what I really wanted to do. CSI is
                        the organising
                        committee of Aaruush, SRM's techno management fest and working in CSI not only skilled me with
                        event planning and
                        organising but also enriched me with discipline and harmony. As a sophomore, I worked with few
                        startups and developed my
                        taste in corporate culture. My hardships paid me and I got promoted to Committee Member from
                        volunteer. I decided to
                        build a team of 50 diligent members and guided them to successfully conduct Aaruush'17. This is
                        when Directorate of
                        Alumni Affairs approached me with a proposal of working in the team. It took me just a single
                        day to grow it from 5 to
                        35 members and 6 months to build a strong community of 70+ members.Working in DAA and conduction
                        various events like
                        Internship Fairs, Achiever's Connect, Alumni Day helped me develop my skills even more and there
                        was no looking back
                        since then in my 3 years tenure. I got promoted from Volunteer to Head Coordinator and from
                        Joint Secretary to
                        Vice-president. That's how I became a better version of myself.</p>

                                participated in crowd management and event management teams. Also, I was deeply involved

                            <p>I had a lot of roles to play in this event. I coordinated with my seniors and juniors to

                                event. It was an immense pleasure for me to align with the company 'Pioneer Design' and
                                bring them to the event. I led
                                the hospitality team, coordinated with Event Management, Market Management and Alumni
